**POWER PLANT EMISSION ANALYSIS**

**Dashboard Link**:

**Overview**
This project aims to conduct an in-depth analysis of the emissions from 20 selected thermal power plants in India. The focus is on understanding the levels of pollutants released by these plants and their impact on the environment and public health.

**Motivation**
The motivation behind this project is to analyse the trend of emission rate from thermal power generation in India. With the country's increasing energy demand, it's crucial to assess the environmental footprint of existing power plants and identify areas for improvement.

**Objectives**
1) Collect emission data: Gather comprehensive data on the emissions of key pollutants (such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, etc.) from the selected thermal power plants.
2) Analyze emission trends: Identify trends and patterns in emission levels over time for each power plant.
3) Compare emissions: Compare the emission levels of different power plants to assess variations and potential factors influencing them.

**Methodology**
1) Data collection: Utilize publicly available data sources, government reports, and research papers to gather emission data for the selected power plants.
2) Data analysis: Employ statistical analysis and data visualization techniques to explore emission trends and patterns.
3) Comparative analysis: Conduct comparative analysis to identify differences in emission levels among the power plants.
4) Data Creation: Wrote MySql codes to create the database and run some querries to get key insights.
5) Data Visualization: After running querries and transforming data on Power BI created an interactive dashboard to highlight the key points.
